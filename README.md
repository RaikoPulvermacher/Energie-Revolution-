# Energie Revolution

## Project Overview
This project aims to revolutionize our approach to energy consumption and production. We delve into the critical issues surrounding energy waste and explore innovative solutions that have the potential to significantly reduce our carbon footprint.

## Reading Guide
To fully understand the concepts and discussions within this project, we recommend starting with the foundational documents provided, including the [Vorhersage.md](link-to-vorhersage.md), which outlines the predictions and analyses central to our thesis.

## Core Thesis: 89% Energy Waste
Our research highlights a staggering fact: approximately 89% of the energy produced is wasted in various forms. This assertion raises important questions about efficiency and sustainability in our current practices.

## LED vs ITER Comparison
In contrasting traditional LED lighting solutions with the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project, we examine the effectiveness and sustainability of alternative energy sources and practices.
